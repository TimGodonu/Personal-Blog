  <h2>2021 Toyota Corolla sedan getting Apex sport appearance package</h2>
  <p>Author: Zac Jeremy | 10/06/2020</em></p><br/>
  <p>
    We promise that there is no typo on the price. Someone just won the auction on Bring a Trailer for $50,000 even. The car in question has 5,600 miles on the odometer and will now be going to its third owner. It’s about as perfect as it gets from an aesthetic and mechanical standpoint, though it does have an unsightly aftermarket Pioneer head unit installed in the dash.
    The Toyota Corolla hatchback has sponged up all the headlines lately thanks to the imminent Corolla Sport GR and "Special Edition." Product planners haven't forgotten about the sedan, according to a piece in Car and Driver, although the goodies on the way are suited for the more conservative sedan buyer. The Apex Sport Package is a cosmetic suite for the mid-grade SE and top-grade XSE trims that should become available "within the next few months." We don't much information on it at the moment, leaving the specific bodywork changes in the category of known unknowns. What is clear is that the 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 169 horsepower and 151 pound-feet of torque won't be touched. Opting for the SE trim opens up the chance to take control with the six-speed manual, but the CVT-equipped SE and XSE are also on the menu.
    A set of summer performance tires is how a Corolla fitted with the Apex Sport Package will get more out of its standard mojo. At the moment, the SE and XSE trims come with 18-inch wheels on Michelin or Yokohama all-season tires. Certain Corolla hatchbacks come with asymmetrical Dunlop high-performance all-season tires; a set of extra-sticky summer rubber on the sedan would outdo those.       
Hoping to give the Apex the look it needs, the option is limited to three exterior colors. A hue called Cement mixes a gray body with a black roof, Super White comes with a black roof, too, and Black Sand Pearl covers everything in the one shade. More information, and pricing, should come our way shortly.

    That trim is a great step up in performance over a base Integra, and a few easy mods gets it close to the Type R from a performance standpoint. You won’t have the cache and bragging rights that come with the R, but you also won’t be afraid to put miles on it for fear of entirely ruining the car’s value. Happy Honda hunting.
    We’re still rather flabbergasted and slightly upset the original buyer only managed 6,000 miles over the approximately 22 years of ownership, but the new owner could fix that quickly. Then again, this could be a purely speculative buy, aiding heavily in the final gavel price.Wait a few months to a year, and the value of this unmolested Type R could increase another $10,000, or more if you don’t add miles.. It was only a year ago to date that we wrote in near-shock about a Type R with even fewer miles (1,200) going for $63,800.

  <h2>The 2020 Land Rover Defender is for sale, but supply is short</h2>
  <p>
    American auction giant Copart is selling one of the earliest examples of the 2020 Chevrolet Corvette built. The catch is that it was wrecked, and it's estimated to cost approximately $48,000 more than a new model.
  </p>
  <p>
    Located in Cleveland, Ohio, the Corvette was manufactured in January 2020, meaning it's one of the first cars off the line. Its build date is a little puzzling, because Chevrolet announced that production started on February 3. It could be one of the cars allegedly made as dealer demonstrators before the company started building customer-ordered cars. Autoblog reached out to Chevrolet for clarification, and we'll update this story if we learn more.
   </p>
   <p>
    What's certain is that, regardless of who owned it, things didn't go as planned. Images published by Copart suggest this Corvette was driven straight-on into something tall, sturdy, and relatively round. We're betting tree. The front end is destroyed, the airbags went off, the passenger side is banged up, and the rear wing is broken. There are no images of the underbody, for better or worse.
    The good news is that, because the Corvette is mid-engined, the model listed by Copart is unlikely to have sustained engine damage unless the impact tore off its oil pan. We'd need to see the car in person to tell if it can be repaired and driven again, but, at worst, its 6.2-liter V8 engine can live on in an unsuspecting 1960s Nova.
    If you're shopping new, you'll need to spend at least $59,995 to put a base 2020 Corvette in your garage, and approximately $75,000 for a mid-range 2LT model with several extra-cost options (including the Z51 package) like the one Copart is selling. Plan to set aside considerably more money if you want to give this gruesomely smashed-up example a chance: Its estimated retail value is $107,699. We won't know if it actually sells for that much until it limps across the auction block, and no date has been set yet, but it's the only 2020 Corvette listed on Copart, and wrecked examples (whether they're used as projects or for parts) don't pop up on a regular basis.
    Enthusiasts who would rather drive than wrench are in luck. Although the eighth-generation Corvette has been in short supply due to the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and the coronavirus pandemic, the Bowling Green, Kentucky, factory that builds it reopened on May 26 and Chevrolet expects to manufacture about 20,000 cars (including 16,750 coupes and 3,431 convertibles) before launching production of the 2021 model on November 2.
